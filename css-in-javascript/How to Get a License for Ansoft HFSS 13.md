If you want to use Ansoft HFSS 13 for your projects, you need to have a valid license from Ansys, the company that develops and sells the software. There are different types of licenses available depending on your needs and budget. In this article, we will explain how to get a license for Ansoft HFSS 13 and what are the benefits of using it.
 
## Types of Licenses for Ansoft HFSS 13
 
Ansys offers two main types of licenses for Ansoft HFSS 13: perpetual and lease. A perpetual license allows you to use the software indefinitely without any time limit or expiration date.
